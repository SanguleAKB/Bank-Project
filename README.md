# BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 
   #### Encoder: 
    BERT employs an encoder-only architecture.
   
   #### Decoder: 
   GPT employs a decoder-only architecture. GPT, or a generative pre-trained transformer, is a type of large language model (LLM) that utilizes deep learning to produce human-like text. Neural networks are trained on massive datasets containing text and code, enabling them to understand and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. As a key component in the field of generative AI, GPT pushes the boundaries of what's possible with AI, enabling machines to produce creative and human-quality content.

##### What is Hagging face? 
Hugging Face is a platform for machine learning and data science that lets users build, train, and share AI models.

##### Transformers: 
It is a hugging face library developed by Hugging Face.  
Transformers provides thousands of pretrained models to perform tasks on different modalities such as text, vision, and audio.Transformers library provides a convenient way to perform transfer learning for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) and even multimodal tasks.
   ###### BertTokenizer 
   - BertTokenizer is a class from the transformers library
   - This class is used to convert input text into token IDs that a BERT model can process.
   ###### BertModel
   - BertModel is a class from the transformers library by Hugging Face. It represents the pre-trained BERT model architecture, which can be used for a variety of tasks like text classification, token classification, question answering, and more.
# BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and similar models are excellent examples of transfer learning in natural language processing (NLP).

### Vertex AI
- Vertex AI in express mode is the fastest way to start building generative AI applications on Google Cloud. Signing up in express mode is quick and easy, and it doesn't require entering any billing information.
